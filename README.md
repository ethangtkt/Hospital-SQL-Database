# üè• Hospital SQL Database
## üéì About The Class
#### CSE385 - Database Systems
I took this during my junior year of college in the fall of 2021. This class explored all of the ideas that created a well-formed database. First, we dabbled and explored ideas in Database Management Systems and what makes one better than another. Next, we applied database architecture and modeling knowledge, creating entity relationship diagrams (ERD) as the first topics we learned. Following up on this topic, we practiced making relational models of our database from our ERD and making them in the highest normal form possible. These topics that I learned are in this final classes project, which was designing a database in a consultant-client scenario.

## ‚Ñπ About The Project
This final project‚Äôs design is to simulate a customer-consultant project. When I took CSE385, this project was two different sub-projects, but I combined it into one Github page to keep it concise. The hospital described how they stored data about their patients. The student‚Äôs job was to create an actual functioning database, but many requirements and tasks between the starting explanation and the final database. One of those requirements was to create an ERD and then make that ERD well-formed. Another necessity was to use Google Cloud Servies and SQL to host and create a database for us. Finally, the student had to maintain a log of our hours throughout this project, keeping it as up-to-date as possible. Overall, there should have been a final, well-formed database where, hypothetically, other software engineers could implement it into a company‚Äôs website.

## üìÉ The Steps To This Project
### üöë Understanding How The "Hospital" Functions
One of the initial tasks of the project was to understand how this hypothetical hospital operates. We had to know how everything worked to store the essential data. To do this, this ‚Äúhospital‚Äù gave us a description (listed below) of how they stored files of patients and more. As I read this repeatedly, I would write down objects they mentioned and their descriptions, sometimes highlighting stuff on the page in different colors. For example, green for action words, like ‚Äúput away‚Äù or ‚Äúprescribe,‚Äù blue for objects, like ‚Äúmedicine‚Äù and ‚Äúpatients,‚Äù and yellow for descriptions, like ‚Äúdosage‚Äù or ‚Äúhours.‚Äù Highlighting these things allowed me to have an excellent understanding of creating an entity-relationship diagram.

| General Description
| :---:
| The Mid-City Hospital has requested a new database design and implementation for their Emergency Room shift management system.  As the database designer tasked with creating the conceptual design, you should read the requirements prepared below and develop a baseline ER diagram, a well-formed ER diagram, and a list of assumptions/questions to discuss with the client.

<br>

| Basic Operations
| :---:
| The Mid-City Emergency Room (MC-ER) has three distinct types of workers: receptionists, nurses, and doctors. Any of the workers can in fact be a patient. Each person in the proposed system, whether a patient or a worker, has a last, a first, possibly a middle name, and one or more addresses. An address consists of a city, state, street, and number. Each person can have zero or more email addresses and zero or more telephone numbers. <br><br> The workers work in the MC-ER in shifts. A shift consists of start and end time (using 2400 as midnight and 1200 as noon; the minute before midnight is 2359, and the minute after is 0001.) The shifts do not overlap, but they are consecutive, i.e., there is a shift on at any given time and day. The database will cover some extended period of time. Each worker will thus be assigned to many shifts in that period. At least one or more receptionists are assigned to each shift, one or more nurses are assigned to each shift, and one or more doctors are assigned to each shift. One of the doctors assigned to a shift is the shift‚Äôs triage doctor.  <br><br> When a patient is admitted to the MC-ER, it happens during a particular shift. The patient is admitted by a particular receptionist and is seen by the triage doctor of the shift. The patient may be sent home, be prescribed some medication by the triage doctor and sent home, or maybe assigned to stay in the MC-ER. <br><br> If a patient stays in the MC-ER, a bed and a case doctor is assigned for the patient. Each bed is supervised by a nurse during a shift. The case doctor may prescribe a medication that is administered to the patient by a nurse in each shift during the patient‚Äôs stay. Each medication has a unique name, and for each patient, there may be a different dosage and a different number of times per day prescribed by the case doctor.  The time and the dosage administered to a patient by a nurse should be recorded.
<br><br>


### üó∫ Creating a Baseline Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)
An Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD), also known as an Entity-Relationship model (ERM), is an efficient way to map a database visually. It allows us to see what is stored within a database and how each entity relates and interacts. It is a truly remarkable first step to creating an efficient database. We first created an ERD based on the description from the hospital, even if some of the stuff didn‚Äôt make sense. Below is the first baseline ERD that I made. It is much easier to make a draft of the ERD and refine it rather than refine it as you go.

### ‚ú® Making the ERD Well-Formed
To make an ERD well-formed is almost like a puzzle. First, you have to look for things to fix and make sure the overall diagram makes sense. Next, I had to fix some of the redundancies, primary keys for objects, some objects needed to relate to other entities, and a few smaller items. Overall, this was my final well-formed ERD.

</p><br>
Along with making an ERD well-formed, you sometimes have to assume stuff relating to your ERD to make sense. In a real-world example, you would take these assumptions to the ‚ÄúHospital‚Äù and make sure they are correct or fix them if they are not. Some of these assumptions include cardinality, weak entities, and relationships. Below are my assumptions for my well-formed ERD above. <br>

<h4 align="center">Well Formed ERD Assumptions</h4>
<table> 
<tbody> 
<tr><th align="center">Related To Primary Keys</th></tr> 
<tr><td>
<ul>
<li>The Address entity was given four attributes: number, street, state, and city. Since all of those are needed to make the key unique, they are all primary composite keys.</li>
<li>Medication was described as having a unique name, thus we made the name attribute a primary key for the medication entity.</li>
<li>A person was given a person_ID since no unique description of a person was given.</li>
<li>A nurse was given a nurse_ID since no unique description of a nurse was given.</li>
<li>A doctor was given a doctor_ID since no unique description of a doctor was given.</li>
<li>A receptionist was given a receptionist_ID since no unique description of a receptionist was given.</li>
<li>A patient was given a patient_ID since no unique description of a patient was given.</li>
<li>A triage doctor has a tdoctor_ID with an identifying relationship since it is a weak entity.</li>
<li>A bed was given a bed_Id since no unique identifier was described for a bed.</li>
<li>A shift‚Äôs start time, end time, and date is a composite primary key since shifts can‚Äôt overlap on a day.</li>
</ul>
</td></tr> 
</tbody>
</table>

<table> 
<tbody> 
<tr><th align="center">Cardinality/Participation Constraints For Relationships</th></tr> 
<tr><td>
<ul>
<li><b>hasA - n:1 (address:person)</b> - A person can have many or zero addresses. For an address to exist it must belong to a person, hence why we have total participation on the right.</li>
<li><b>assigned - n:n (person:shift)</b> - A person, if they are a doctor, nurse, or receptionist, will be assigned multiple shifts over a given schedule. A shift must have multiple workers for the hospital to function.</li>
<li><b>isA - 1:1 (person:nurse)</b> - A single nurse can be only a single person. A single person can be only a single nurse. For a nurse to exist, there must be total participation from the person entity.</li>
<li><b>isA - 1:1 (person:doctor)</b> - A single doctor can be only a single person. A single person can be only a single doctor. For a doctor to exist, there must be total participation from the person entity.</li>
<li><b>isA - 1:1 (person:patient)</b> - A single patient can be only a single person. A single person can be only a single patient. For a patient to exist, there must be total participation from the person entity.</li>
<li><b>isA - 1:1 (person:receptionist)</b> - A single receptionist can be only a single person. A single person can be only a single receptionist. For a receptionist to exist, there must be total participation from the person entity.</li>
<li><b>isA - 1:1 (doctor:triageDoctor)</b> - A single doctor can be only a single triage doctor. A single triage doctor can be only a single doctor. Total participation is on the left since a doctor needs to exist for a triage doctor to exist.</li>
<li><b>administered - n:n (medication:nurse)</b> - Many different nurses can administer a patient many different types of medication.</li>
<li><b>supervised - 1:n (nurse:bed)</b> - One nurse may supervise many different beds depending on how many nurses are on a shift.</li>
<li><b>assigned - 1:1 (bed:patient)</b> - One patient can only be given a single bed at a time. A single bed has an occupancy of one.</li>
<li><b>admitted (shift, person, receptionist)</b> - A person is admitted by a certain receptionist during a certain shift.</li>
<li><b>prescribed (doctor, medication, patient)</b> - A doctor prescribes medication to a patient.</li>
</ul>
</td></tr>

</table>

<table> 
<tbody> 
<tr><th align="center">Miscellaneous</th></tr> 
<tr><td>
<ul>
<li>A triage doctor is a weak entity since it can‚Äôt exist unless a doctor exists.</li>
<li>The relationship admitted‚Äôs attributes: admit_date, admit_time, discharge_date, primaryDiagnosis, and discharge_time could all be different per person, shift, and receptionist. For example, if a single person was admitted twice on different days, the date would be different hence why it belongs to the relationship rather than an entity.</li>
<li>The relationship administered‚Äôs attributes timeAdministered, dosage, and timesPerDay belong to the relationship rather than an entity because these attributes can vary from patient to patient.</li>

### üíΩ Turning The ERD Into Relational Form
There is a simple formula to turn entity-relationship form into relational form. This step is needed to start creating a schema that a user can interact with. Or in other words, we are taking a diagram and turning it into something that can be imputed into a computer. We turn every entity to its own table in the schema most of the time. Here is a link to the full translation guide of transforming the ERD to a relational form. We got this relational form after applying the translation to our own well-formed ERD.<br>
