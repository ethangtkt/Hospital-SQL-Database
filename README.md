# 🏥 Hospital SQL Database
## 🎓 About The Class
#### CSE385 - Database Systems
I took this during my junior year of college in the fall of 2021. This class explored all of the ideas that created a well-formed database. First, we dabbled and explored ideas in Database Management Systems and what makes one better than another. Next, we applied database architecture and modeling knowledge, creating entity relationship diagrams (ERD) as the first topics we learned. Following up on this topic, we practiced making relational models of our database from our ERD and making them in the highest normal form possible. These topics that I learned are in this final classes project, which was designing a database in a consultant-client scenario.

## ℹ About The Project
This final project’s design is to simulate a customer-consultant project. When I took CSE385, this project was two different sub-projects, but I combined it into one Github page to keep it concise. The hospital described how they stored data about their patients. The student’s job was to create an actual functioning database, but many requirements and tasks between the starting explanation and the final database. One of those requirements was to create an ERD and then make that ERD well-formed. Another necessity was to use Google Cloud Servies and SQL to host and create a database for us. Finally, the student had to maintain a log of our hours throughout this project, keeping it as up-to-date as possible. Overall, there should have been a final, well-formed database where, hypothetically, other software engineers could implement it into a company’s website.
